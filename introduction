This book is linked together and divided into repositories. 

Which means you can read it a bit like how you listen to an album these days.

Mix and match content to create your own channels. Contribute to existing streams. Cite each other's work.

Each submission is called an essay. It can be text, audio, video or photo, or a combination therein. 

Authors own their contributions. Usage means the potential to earn revenue. You can always refute the way your content is being represented in someone else's argument, but you cannot deny the association.
