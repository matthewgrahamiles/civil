The problem:

- Consumers don't know what's going on around them. 

- Consumers feel isolated or stuck in a bubble within their wider community.

- Consumers feel disengaged and distrusting of government and media, especially at national levels.

Consequential:

- The news information market is highly inefficienct, especially at local levels. 

- 'Buyers' and 'sellers' of news information cannot identify each other, even in densely populated areas where they presumably pass by one another everyday.

- Consumers can't easily and reliably acquire news information, so tend to stick to roughly the same patterns of behavior interacting with roughly the same social circles while simultaneously growing distant from large swaths of the community and community organization itself.

THe customers:

- ANYONE WHO ATTENDS LOCAL EVENTS SUCH AS FLEA MARKETS, FARMER’S MARKETS, SCHOOL SPORTS, COMMUNITY MEETINGS, PERFORMANCES, GRAND OPENINGS, PARADES AND BLOCK PARTIES.


- ANYONE WHO USES TOOLS TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS LOCALLY, SUCH AS DATING APPS, NETWORKING APPS, MEETUPS AND INDUSTRY CONFERENCES, COMMUNITY AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS, REC LEAGUES AND HOBBY CLASSES.


- ANYONE WHO PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES PROFESSIONALLY, SEMI-PROFESSIONALLY, AS A VOLUNTEER OR THROUGH ANY FORM OF DONATION.

CIVIL WILL GROW BY LEVERAGING THE SOCIAL MEDIA POWER LAW:

- 1% OF USERS -- SOME MUNICIPAL REPRESENTATIVES WITH A MESSAGE FOR THE COMMUNITY, SOME WHO JUST WANT TO SHARE THEIR OPINION FREQUENTLY. 


- 10% OF USERS -- ANOTHER PORTION OF THE USERBASE WILL CURATE, CORROBORATE AND QUESTION THE PRIMARY SOURCE NEWS INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ENTIRE NETWORK, AND THEY’LL ALSO CONTRIBUTE ORIGINAL INFORMATION SOMETIMES. 


- 89% OF USERS WILL ONLY CONSUME, CONTRIBUTING RARELY DURING MOMENTOUS OR SOMETIMES EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.


Unique value proposition:

- Civil uses professional editors and data science to source and synthesize verified news information from its users, then author and distribute short- and long-form news stories back to its users on a personalized basis through SMS. 

Solutions:

- Local and domain-expert editors will source regular news information across 3 key areas: government and civic servants (health, education), business and development, and events and activities.

- Editors will also develop investigative and trend pieces that keep their constituents aware of what's happening at a more macro and insider way.

- The system will also detect and verify breaking news and responsibly report it to affected and relevant members.

Unfair advantage:

- Scale of source information. With fewer editors on staff, Civil will possess better access than virtually any traditional news organization because of its widely distributed participatory user base.

- Feasibility of high quality local coverage. With so much source material from the community at our fingertips, Civil can reasonably offer high quality local news information at a historically low cost.

- Highly devoted user base. Participating members will vastly increase the reach of their message at low cost, develop strong community ties and reputation via connections forged through Civil, effectively deriving more value from greater participation and thus creating highly retentive behavior.
