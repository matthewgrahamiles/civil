Unique value proposition:

- Civil uses professional editors and data science to source and synthesize verified news information from its users, then author and distribute short- and long-form news stories back to its users on a personalized basis through SMS. 

Solutions:

- Local and domain-expert editors will source regular news information across 3 key areas: government and civic servants (health, education), business and development, and events and activities.

- Editors will also develop investigative and trend pieces that keep their constituents aware of what's happening at a more macro and insider way.

- The system will also detect and verify breaking news and responsibly report it to affected and relevant members.

Unfair advantage:

- Scale of source information. With fewer editors on staff, Civil will possess better access than virtually any traditional news organization because of its widely distributed participatory user base.

- Feasibility of high quality local coverage. With so much source material from the community at our fingertips, Civil can reasonably offer high quality local news information at a historically low cost.

- Highly devoted user base. Participating members will vastly increase the reach of their message at low cost, develop strong community ties and reputation via connections forged through Civil, effectively deriving more value from greater participation and thus creating highly retentive behavior.
