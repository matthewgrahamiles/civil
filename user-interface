Use cases

The Civil news messaging platform distributes quality, original reporting via chat, inviting the user to engage to learn more. The user can respond with questions, comments or even new information that Civil then responds to quickly at the individual level while also rendering updates to other relevant parties throughout the network.

Alternatively, the user can pull news from Civil, asking anything about what's going on, kicking off a network- and editor-powered process of generating quality, original information.

The Civil news messaging platform is comprised of 3 component parts that together add up to more than the sum of their parts and that increases in value the larger, more diverse it gets.

1. Artificial intelligence
2. Human editors
3. Participating users
