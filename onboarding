- Welcome to Civil. We want to make cities more like neighborhoods, countries more like cities, and the planet more like a spaceship.

- We should be better at talking to each other. We should be better informed, more civically engaged and more enthusiastic about our candidates. 

- We believe the answer is called “mesh journalism” — a crowdsourced and crowd-edited approach to news.

- This only works because this community (people like you!) tell us what’s going on.

- Reporters and editors canvas their sources within the community for news based on what's going on, and what needs investigation.

- Everything we publish is original, trustworthy news. Everything you see is a conversation, inviting you to participate and debate.

- Mean, threatening or demeaning commentary is fundamentally prohibited without exception. We encourage heated disagreements based on principles with a dash of etiquette, but we practice a strong sense of civility at all times. For more on our community guidelines, go here.

- We need more people like you to help make this vision of a thriving 21st century city a reality here. Do you want to learn more?

Yes / No

No
- Oh, that's too bad. Do you have any questions or concerns first that we can answer? 

Yes
- Great! To get started, we need you to complete two activities. 

One is a simple demographic survey about who you are, where you live, etc. This takes about 5-10m max.

The other is more involved and focused more on getting to know you better as a person, and as a citizen of this city. We want to know what issues matter most to you, how you feel about the general direction of the city and its public servants, and what you want to stay in the know about on a consistent basis. This takes about 20-30m, and we've made the experience actually really fun. This is most important information for us to make Civil smarter and more effective for you and the rest of the community.
