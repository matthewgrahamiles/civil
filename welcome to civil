Why I quit, and what's next.

- new apt
- BK / NYC
- complex systems
- incapatability btw institutions and communities in a complex system
- when this incompatibility is brought to bear on something very crucial, very complex, we get the news media, original journalism and civic engagement system that we have today
- history: newspapers were once famously profitable and monopolistic. For the first time, a large yet targeted audience was addressable by relevant advertisers in a lucrative way.
- what happened: as media options expanded and finally the internet made content free and advertising cheap, it became untenable to produce high quality journalism, especially at the local level. 
- the problem: today, there is an enormous lack of awareness especially at the local and regional levels; and whatever content does exist there is poor quality.
- the opportunity: and yet, people are thirsting for change more than ever: they are moving to cities (or not), they can't meet people, they don't know what's going on, they feel disconnected and unrepresented by their politicians and government, they feel disconnected from their neighbors and communities -- what's called "being alone together"
- now if you try to solve this problem with an institution, you'll fail. You'll produce an incremental improvement at best and you'll grow very slowly as long as you focus on local (which I think is the biggest opportunity)
- but if you try to solve it with a community, treat the problem as a complex system, you get a very different looking company that could achieve incredibly rapid high growth
- so imagine this:

Hi - what's going on?

It's time we had a better answer to that question.

At Civil, We believe a world in which we harness our natural desire to connect, inform, debate and learn from one another at scale is more fascinating than a world in which we don't.

We believe tomorrow's strongest societies, healthiest democracies, most engaged communities and most vibrant cities will be more connected, more aware, better informed, and more engaged. 

We believe in the power of communities over institutions; 

In the power of participation over consumption;

In the power of truthfulness over objectivity;

We are Civil.
