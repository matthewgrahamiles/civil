# How we work
We are going to discuss our working schedule. Because we do not have to abide by 9-5p Monday-Friday. 

What do we want to do collectively?
- Share information
- Brainstorm
- Make decisions
- Performance reviews
- Hiring, firing

I say Mondays at 3pm we have an all-hands company meeting with snacks and tea. 

People with news speak up. Hereâ€™s how.

- I open things up with my own summary of the news and important takeaways.
- Head of Growth walks through KPI performance summary and ad hoc deep-dive investigations.
- We review our objectives.
- We discuss our priorities. 
- We brainstorm solutions.
- We leave by 6pm, often much earlier.

Meeting blocks. Meetings can only be scheduled after 330p. Spontaneous or ad hoc meetings are fine any time.
