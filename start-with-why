Civil

We are a locally connective, globally sourced news media platform. 

//

What's going on? 

It's time we had a better answer to that question.

At Civil, We believe a world in which we harness our natural desire to connect, inform, debate and learn from one another at scale is more fascinating than a world in which we don't.

We believe tomorrow's strongest societies, healthiest democracies, most engaged communities and most vibrant cities will be more connected, more aware, better informed, and more engaged. 

We believe in the power of communities over institutions; 

In the power of participation over consumption;

In the power of truthfulness over objectivity;

We are Civil.
