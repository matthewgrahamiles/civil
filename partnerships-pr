- Katie and Johnny could spearhead our NYC community development project.

— Katie I want you to get that art gallery from Williamsburg to commission a Brooklyn-wide art show. It’s going to take part in two phases: One component of the piece will be shown along with the others in a fundraising gallery event somewhere unique and special, the other piece will be somewhere in Brooklyn at the artist’s discretion. The hunt is on for these other pieces, and social media takes off finding each one as a unit across the city. Pokemon Go as a team with cool art instead of anime animals. 

— Brooklyn Magazine cover story pitch.
— — Ask JBC if they know anyone there. Find out who to contact.

Hi, we’re Earth.

Earth is a global community space

Email Lindsay at Sidewalk Labs that we need to discuss 2 ideas: Civil and Earth. 

Forge partnerships with cool well known brands like McNally Jackson, Four And Twenty Blackbirds, Threes to speak on behalf of the people; get partnerships with others such as education, labor, government, health, etc. Line up the partnerships as a matter of necessity to get started.
